# CHONK!
```{r}
# TO DO:
# 1. create a new .R file that calculates 5 diff values (summary info)
#    - the file is summary_values.R, has everything
# 2. Write a dynamic paragraph abt summary info in index.Rmd
# 3. Create table for summary info (?)
# 4. Create chart/values for fires.csv
#    - charts present in fire_charts.R
# 5. Update project proposal (edit project goals)
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## Dynamic Paragraph (change to better name)
[dynamic paragraph placeholder; highlight the summary values]

summary info table:
```{r, warning=F, echo=F}
library(knitr)
source("../source/summary_values.R")
kable(summary_values_df)
```


### Sourcing Oceania Temperature Changes 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/Oceania_Temp_Change_Chart2.R")
oceania_bar_graph
oceania_avg_temp <- avg_oceania_temp_change

```
  
  Average temperature change in Oceania: `r oceania_avg_temp`

Paragraph answering: Beneath each chart, you must include a brief paragraph, describing 
**why** you included the chart and **what** information it reveals, including notable observations
and insights from the chart.

### Sourcing Habitable Exoplanets 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
source("../source/exoplanet-chart-code.R")
habitable_exoplanets
```

Paragraph answering: Beneath each chart, you must include a brief paragraph, describing 
**why** you included the chart and **what** information it reveals, including notable observations
and insights from the chart.

### Sourcing Fires by State Map
```{r, echo=F}
# fires.csv chart reference code here
```

Paragraph answering: Beneath each chart, you must include a brief paragraph, describing 
**why** you included the chart and **what** information it reveals, including notable observations
and insights from the chart.

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
