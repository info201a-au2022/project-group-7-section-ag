## **Abstract**
We are concerned with the ***future of our planet*** and how it can be influenced by ***space exploration***. Climate change has undoubtedly shaped the future of life on Earth and we believe with greater knowledge about stars and planets beyond our solar system, we will be able to ***prepare for life beyond Earth***. To address thiss concern, we plan to gather data about ***stars and exoplanets*** into a concise website that is able to filter specific information for users curious about space!

## Keywords
* Shaping the future
* Space exploration
* Stars and exoplanets

## Introduction
***Mission: Planet*** is a project in which we look at star, explanet and Earth data to analyze how our species might survive beyond Earth's lifespan. On our website, we hope to have a filtering feature in which ussers can select certain features (e.g. temperature, distance, size) to compare exoplanets and stars with each other.<br>
We'll look at features of habitable planets and how patterns between the planetss themselves and their parent sstrar can help us more easily identifiy other planets capable of sustaining human life. We will also consider the ethics behidn space exploration: how it may affect views about sustainablity on Earth, what we need to take into account when we arrive at another planet or encounter another civilized society of some species. Considering the possible consequences of space exploration will allow us to better prepare for our future and how life on Earth will change with greater knowledge about outer space.

## Problem Domain
Our topic is about outer space, specifically how we can discover and study exoplanets and their surroundings to determine if they are habitable. Our topic concerns human well-being, as the state of Earth may affect the ability for humans to inhabit it in the future ([Vince, 2022](https://time.com/6209432/climate-change-where-we-will-live/)). 

We hope to frame our project around data goals. We want to use data gathered about exoplanets and the stars they are near to find patterns in how features in one may reflect features of the other (e.g., the size of a star corresponding to a certain mass of an exoplanet nearby). We also want to include data about Earth to give users of the website an idea as to what features an exoplanet needs in order to sustain human life in the future. Lastly, we hope to touch on the ethics behind our project. There are concerns with how the search for a new planet could lead to changes in how we treat Earth and with what we should do if we encounter extraterrestrial life ([Munro, 2022](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/if-humanity-is-to-succeed-in-space-our-ethics-must-evolve/)). 

Human values our topic touches on self-reliance, determination, and problem solving. Our issue we hope to help solve is one that concerns the future of the human race. The future is in our own hands and with these values in mind, we may be able to better prepare and anticipate issues for generations to come.

Direct stakeholders for our website include astronomy enthusiasts who want to learn more about exoplanets and stars, policymakers supporting the increase in space exploration and investment, and aerospace engineers and researchers, who may use our data as a starting point in creating new technologies and designs that find exoplanets and study their habitability ([Burbach, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964617300693)). Indirect stakeholders include citizens who may be affected by decisions made by the govâ€™t and policymakers who use our website.

Harms that may come from our project largely concern the ethics behind what we hope to achieve. Encouraging the search for other habitable planets may cause people to treat Earth as disposable. Colonizing other planets with the possibility of bringing bacteria, disease, and other harmful elements should be discussed ([Dirks, 2021](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ethics-of-sending-humans-to-mars/)). Benefits from our project could include the increased interest and investment in space exploration. Preparing early for the potential relocation of humans is another benefit, as our data could be implemented to discover new exoplanets and determine their living conditions.

## Appendix A: Questions
* Is our topic a good topic?
* Is it okay for the topic to be a bit more broad and have multiple topic goals?
* Can we make slight alterations to our topic later if we discover we want to include something not mentioned here or get rid of something?
