## Abstract
We are concerned with the future of our planet and how it can be influenced by space exploration. Climate changed has undoubtedly shaped the future of life on Earth and we believe with greater knowledge about stars and planets beyond our solar system, we will be able to prepare for life beyond Earth. To address thiss concern, we plan to gather data about stars and exoplanets into a concise website that is able to filter specific information for users curious about space!

## Keywords
* Shaping the future
* Space exploration
* Stars and explanets

## Introduction
Mission: Planet is a project in which we look at star, explanet and Earth data to analyze how our species might survive beyond Earth's lifespan. On our website, we hope to have a filtering feature in which ussers can select certain features (e.g. temperature, distance, size) to compare exoplanets and stars with each other.<br>
We'll look at features of habitable planets and how patterns between the planetss themselves and their parent sstrar can help us more easily identifiy other planets capable of sustaining human life. We will also consider the ethics behidn space exploration: how it may affect views about sustainablity on Earth, what we need to take into account when we arrive at another planet or encounter another civilized society of some species. Considering the possible consequences of space exploration will allow us to better prepare for our future and how life on Earth will change with greater knowledge about outer space.
