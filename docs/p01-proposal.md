## Abstract
&emsp;We are concerned with the future of our planet and how it can be influenced by space exploration. Climate changed has undoubtedly shaped the future of life on Earth and we believe with greater knowledge about stars and planets beyond our solar system, we will be able to prepare for life beyond Earth. To address thiss concern, we plan to gather data about stars and exoplanets into a concise website that is able to filter specific information for users curious about space!

## Keywords
* Shaping the future
* Space exploration
* Stars and exoplanets

## Introduction
&emsp;Mission: Planet is a project in which we look at star, explanet and Earth data to analyze how our species might survive beyond Earth's lifespan. On our website, we hope to have a filtering feature in which ussers can select certain features (e.g. temperature, distance, size) to compare exoplanets and stars with each other.<br>
&emsp;We'll look at features of habitable planets and how patterns between the planets themselves and their parent star can help us more easily identifiy other planets capable of sustaining human life. We will also consider the ethics behidn space exploration: how it may affect views about sustainablity on Earth, what we need to take into account when we arrive at another planet or encounter another civilized society of some species. Considering the possible consequences of space exploration will allow us to better prepare for our future and how life on Earth will change with greater knowledge about outer space.

## Problem Domain

## Research Questions

## The Dataset

## Expected Limitations
&emsp;Assuming our research questions are answered, a possible implication for technologiests could be to advance space exploration technology to utilize the features of stars to more efficiently discover new habitable exoplanets. Other features technologists may want to touch on could include analyzing certain parts of exploanets, like ssurface temperature and water temperature and availablity and temperature to understand how the exoplanet compares to Earth.<br>
&emsp;Designers may use reserach question answerss in their implication of designing space exploration technology. Designers must keep certain ethics, like the mistreatment of Earth that results from finding other habitable planets and how to approach bringing humnan life to other planets, in mind as they create new technologies.<br>
&emsp;Lastly, expected implications of our research conclusions and answers for policymakers include policies behind the ethics of space exploration. There are a number of concerns with how knowledge we've gathered may shape perspectives on the treatment of Earth and of life outside Earth. 

## Limitations
&emsp;Limitations we may face include not having the appropriate data to answer the questions we have posed. We might not have been able to find the data we want and that can limit the extent to which we are able to answer our reserach questions. We also may not be able to discuss every possible opinion people might have in regards to our questions. People have diverse views about all kidns of topics and we may only be able to think of and address a small portion of those perspectives. We also can only approach the questions based on our own background and knowledge. We are not astronomy experts so what we know and say as a result is limited. We also are not fortune tellers who can see the future so what we say may not end up being true or acutally happen. We just propose what we think is likely to happen based on the data we have collected.

## Appendix A: Questions
* Is our topic a good topic?
* Is it okay for the topic to be a bit more broad and have multiple topic goals?
* Can we make slight alterations to our topic later if we discover we want to include something not mentioned here or get rid of something?
